  objectDescription: "I\u2019m so excited, Amelie! I can\u2019t believe we\u2019ve
    almost finished work on the AM Gun! For the first time in months, something finally
    goes right! By the way, I\u2019ve started developing some blueprints for upgrades.
    That thing has so much potential!\r\nFeel free to develop your own, as I\u2019m
    sure you\u2019re already eager to do! You just need to insert your blueprints
    in the gun matrix and the imbedded AI converter will add the new capabilities
    to your weapon. Amazing, isn\u2019t it?\u201D\r\n"
