  objectDescriptionTitle: Anti-Matter Gun Manual
  objectDescription: "The Anti-Matter (AM) Gun is designed to shoot a concentrated
    ball of anti-matter up to an effective range of 25 feet, dissolving the atomic
    links of anything it comes into contact with. \r\nIn its current version (2.8.9),
    the AM Gun is only effective against red-colored materials. Our scientists believe
    it has something to do with the light\u2019s wavelength, as it is reflected differently
    on each color of the spectrum. \r\nAs a result, the AM projectiles will disintegrate
    any red object they come into contact with, while being completely harmless against
    other materials. \r\nBE AWARE AND STAY SAFE! An object does NOT need to be completely
    red to be disintegrated! A spot of red coming into contact with a projectile is
    sufficient to erase an entire object from existence (the term \u2018object\u2019
    includes human beings).\r\n"
