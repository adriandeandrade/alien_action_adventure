  objectDescriptionTitle: Fate is Bullshit
  objectDescription: 'Fate is bullshit. We finally finished work on the Antimatter
    Gun but it''s radiation output is just too much to handle. Amelie literally melted
    when she tested that fucking thing. Maybe the clones could have survived such
    intense radiation, but I guess we''ll never know.


    I hid the gun in the secret lab, behind the cloning vats. If anyone alive reads
    this and wants to test their luck, the switch to the secret door is on the control
    panel button set. It sshould be the bright green one.'
