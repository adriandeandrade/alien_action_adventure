  objectDescription: "\u201CFate is bullshit. We finished our work on the Antimatter
    Gun but its radiation output is just too much to handle. Amelie literally melted
    when she tested that fucking thing. Maybe the clones could have survived such
    intense radiation, but I guess we\u2019ll never know. \r\n\n\r\nI hid the gun
    in the secret lab, behind the cloning vats. If anyone alive reads this and wants
    to test their luck, the switch to the lab\u2019s door is on the control panel.
    It should be the bright green button in the middle.\u201D\r\n"
